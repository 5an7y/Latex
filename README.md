# Latex-Templates

Here are the templates I use/create in Latex, hope you find it useful.

In the files are "%comments" that let you identify more easily each thing. Also, the comments have parenteshis on things like configuration, so you can click the close mark (down arrow) in Overleaf and have a cleaner code, and focus in what you really need.

The templates will be in espanish (Esp) and english (En). And they will have some text example that makes you see how are the enviroments use, and various of things that the template have.
